# Collection_ListInterface_practicals
This repository contains practical exercises and examples for working with collection list interfaces in various programming languages.

Introduction
Collection List Interfaces are fundamental data structures in programming that allow storing and manipulating collections of elements. These interfaces are implemented differently across programming languages, but they generally provide functionalities such as adding, removing, accessing, and iterating over elements.

This repository aims to provide practical exercises and examples for understanding and implementing collection list interfaces in different programming languages.
